2. **Grammars: Synthetic Examples**.

  a) Describe the language defined by the following grammar:
  ```
  S ::= ABA
  A ::= a|aA
  B ::= ε|bBc|BB
  ```
  S is defined by 'A' followed by 'B' followed by an 'A'
  
  A is defined by either an "a" or an "aA"
  
  B is defined by an "ε" or "bBc" or "BB"
  
  b) Consider the following grammar:
  ```
  S ::= AaBb
  A ::= Ab|b
  B ::= aB|a
  ```
  
  Which of the following sentences are in the language generated by this grammar? For the sentences that are described by this grammar, demonstrate that they are by giving **derivations**.
  
  1. baab     ``AaBb => baBb => baab``
  2. ~~bbbab~~
  3. ~~bbaaaaa~~
  4. bbaab    ``AaBb => AbaBb => bbaBb => bbaab``
  
  (from Sebesta, Chapter 3)
  
  c) Consider the following grammar:
  ```
  S ::= aScB|A|b
  A ::= cA|c
  B ::= d|A
  ```
  Which of the following sentences are in the language generated by this grammar? For the sentences that are described by this grammar, demonstrate that they are by giving **parse trees**.
  
  1. abcd
  ```
            aScB
      /      |     \
  aaScBcB  aAcB   abcB
                  /   \
                abcd  abcA
  ```
  2. ~~acccbd~~ 
  3. ~~acccbcc~~
  4. ~~acd~~
  5. accc 
  ```
            aScB
      /      |     \
  aaScBcB  aAcB   abcB
          /    \
       acAcB  accB
              /   \
           accd   accA
                  /   \
              acccA   accc
  ```
 
  (from Sebesta, Chapter 3)
  
  d) Consider the following grammar:
  ```
  A ::= a|b|A○A
  ```
  Show that this grammar is ambiguous  
  ``A => A○A => aoAoA => aoboa``  
  ``A => A○A => A○Aoa => aoboa``
  
  e) Let us ascribe a semantics to the syntactic objects A specified in the above grammar from part A. In particular, let us write
  ```
  A ↓ n
  ```
  for the judgment form that should mean A has a total n a symbols where n is the metavariable for natural numbers. Define this judgment form via a set of inference rules. You may rely upon arithmetic operators over natural numbers. Hint: There should be one inference rule for each production of the non-terminal A (called a syntax-directed judgment form).
  
3. **Grammars: Understanding a Language**.

  a) Consider the following two grammars for expressions e. In both grammars, operator and operand are the same; you do not need to know their productions for this question.
  ```
  e ::= operand|e operator operand
  
  e ::= operand esuffix
   esuffix ::= operator operand esuffix|ε
  ```
  
  1. Intuitively describe the expressions generated by the two grammars.  
  ```
  e operator operand => operand operator operand
  operand esuffix => operand operator operand esuffix => operand operator operand ε
  ```
  2. Do these grammars generate the same or different expressions? Explain.  
  They generate different expressions ``e operator operand => operand operator operand`` and ``operand esuffix => operand operator operand esuffix => operand operator operand ε``
  
  b) Write a Scala expression to determine if ‘−’ has higher precedence than ‘<<’ or vice versa. Make sure that you are checking for precedence in your expression and not for left or right associativity. Use parentheses to indicate the possible abstract syntax trees, and then show the evaluation of the possible expressions. Finally, explain how you arrived at the relative precedence of ‘−’ and ‘<<’ based on the output that you saw in the Scala interpreter.
 ```
 val test1 2 << 5-2
 val test2 5-2 << 2
 val test3 2 << (5-2)
 val test4 (5-2) << 2
 ```
 '-' takes precdence over '<<' because when '-' was isolated in the parethises the results were the same.

  c) Give a BNF grammar for floating point numbers that are made up of a fraction (e.g., 5.6 or 3.123 or -2.5) followed by an optional exponent (e.g., E10 or E-10). The exponent, if it exists, is the letter ‘E’ followed by an integer. For example, the following are floating point numbers: 3.5E3, 3.123E30, -2.5E2, -2.5E-2, and 3.5. The following are not examples of floating point numbers: 3.E3, E3, and 3.0E4.5.
  ```
  X ::= N.N|-N.N
  E ::= X^N|X^-N
  N ::= 1|2|3|4|5|6 ... |IR
  
  ```
